# Slack Webhooks Github Crawler
This script search for Slack Webhooks token publicly exposed on Github.com

Slack webhooks are easy to search on Github since they have all the same format:
`https://hooks.slack.com/services/TXXXXXXXX/BXXXXXXXX/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

## The Social Expeoriment
I've run this script on a cloud function every hour for 6 months and in total I've collected more than **6500 Slack Webhooks**.
Afterward I've sent a message to all the #general channels warning that they have an exposed token on Github.
The message received by the people was the following:

### Results
In total I've sent ~6500 Slack messages and the youtube video that was explaining the experiment had ~3700 views, so we can assume that roughly 57% of webhooks are still valid.
\* Supposing that only one person had watched this video per channel

### Comments
Most of the people appreciated that I've sent a message to them and warned them about their security problems.
You can read all the comments under the youtube video that I've sent to them:

Since there are a lot of results the scirpt search a  specific programming language and a "mode" that is the sorting option.
